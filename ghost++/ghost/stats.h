// the stats class is passed a copy of every player action in ProcessAction when it's received
// then when the game is over the Save function is called
// so the idea is that you parse the actions to gather data about the game, storing the results in any member variables you need in your subclass
// and in the Save function you write the results to the database
// e.g. for dota the number of kills/deaths/assists, etc...
// the base class is almost completely empty
