### whether to send "local admin messages" or not
###  these messages are battle.net chat messages, whispers, and emotes which the bot receives and passes on to the "local admin"
###  the local admin is the game owner if they are playing from a LAN or the same computer as the bot
###  this is useful when you are using the admin game to play with one set of CD keys and you want messages sent to the bot to be relayed to you
###  you can enable or disable this for a particular game with the !messages command

### the "TCP no delay" flag
###  this controls whether or not your operating system should use the "no delay" algorithm on game sockets
###  the algorithm is designed to reduce latency by sending data in small packets as soon as possible rather than waiting to send a single larger packet
###  enabling this algorithm requires additional bandwidth because it is a less efficient way of sending data
###  however, it may reduce game latencies in some cases

### the matchmaking method
###  this controls how the bot matches players when they join the game when using !autohostmm
###  set it to 0 to disable matchmaking (first come first served, even if their scores are very different)
###  set it to 1 to use the "furthest score" method (the player with the furthest score from the average is kicked to make room for another player)
###  set it to 2 to use the "lowest score" method (the player with the lowest score is kicked to make room for another player)

### the mapgametype overwrite (advance)
###  This controls the mapgametype overwrite. Use with caution as this can result in an ipban from battle.net services or make users unavailable to join your bot with an invalid number
###  Example numbers can be found at (http://www.codelain.com/forum/index.php?topic=11373.msg135301#msg135301)
